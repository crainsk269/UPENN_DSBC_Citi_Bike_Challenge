### Analysis

##### This analysis consisted of a little over 2.1 million records for the month of June 2020. Categories that were analyzed consisted of Starting and Ending locations, Age Groups, Gender Groups, Usertype Groups, and Average Time of Use.

### 1. Starting and Ending Locations

#### Citi Bike has locations in the New York City Boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx; with the majority of locations being in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Of the locations, both the Top 10 Starting and Ending Stations are all located in Manhattan; nine of the top ten were the same in both groups. This is most likely due to everything that is located in Manhattan such as: Wall Street and the rest of the Financial District, the many corporations located in Midtown, Central Park, Harlem, and Columbia University. Many people use these bikes to commute back-and-forth from work or school, while other simply use them to get around the city. NYC is a very crowded city and traffic moves slowly and the subway is not much better. So, Citi bikes area great alternative to get where you want to go quickly and inexpensively. What is ironic when looking at both the Start and End Station Maps is that there are no Start Stations in New Jersey, however, there are End Stations in New Jersey.

### 2. Average Trip Duration by Age Group, Gender, and Usertype

#### In both the Male and Female Groups, the highest average usage is in the 40-49 Age Group and also the Customer Usertype which is pay-as-you go. The second highest average usage time belonged to the 70 and Over Group; this was also in the Customer Usertype Group for both Males and Females. The first difference we see is in third place where it belonged to the 30-39 Age Group for Males and the 60-69 Age Group for Females. When comparing the Males and Females in both Usertype Groups and all Age Groups, the Females have the higher numbers which shows that they are using the Citi Bikes for longer periods than their Male counterparts. Looking at the Average Usage for the two Usertypes for both Males and Females; the Male Subscribers time was 52.68% less than the Male Customers, and the Female Subscribers usage time was 51.37% less than the Female Customers.

### Summary

#### In summary, Citi Bikes can be found in four of the five NYC Boroughs with both the Top 10 Starting and Ending Locations being in the Borough of Manhattan. There are more male customers and subscribers than there are female customers and subscribers; almost a 2:1 ratio. However, the female average usage time is higher than the male average usage time in all age groups. The 40-49 Age Group for both males and females have the highest average usage times compared to the rest of the age groups. This analysis is based on those individuals who identified themselves as either male or female. There is a fairly large group who fell into the Unknown Category but those individuals' records were not used during this analysis.
